# Service Workers

A service worker is a script that is run by your browser in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features which don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and in the future it will include other things like, background sync, or geofencing. The core feature discussed in this tutorial is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses.
